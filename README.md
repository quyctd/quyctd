### Hi there, I'm [quyctd!](https://github.com/quyctd) ğŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer from Vietnam ğŸ‡»ğŸ‡³
<br/>
I am interested in developing a wide range of skills in diverse fields that would complement each other in unexpected ways. So I engrained this idea to my lifestyle, and created a goal of learning one new thing in depth every trimester.
